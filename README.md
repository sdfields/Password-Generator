# Password Generator

# Description
This repository is my first attempt at creating a password generator with specific criteria.

# Goal
The intention is to display a generated password between 8 and 128 numbers using lowercase, uppercase, numbers and symbols.

# Use
To use the password generator select the red "Generate Password" at the bottom of the display and select the number of characters you would like to use and the types of characters. Within the dialog box, "OK" represents a yes and "Cancel" represents a no.
